## Game Rules

1. Player-1 creates the game room and shares the game code with minimum 1 player and maximum 3 more players and initiates the game.
2. Each player playing as a Pac-Man munches his way around the maze, eating the small Pac dots, Power Pellets and food.
3. There are some scattered Power Pellets which when the Pac-Man eats, turns into a big Pac-Man for 5 seconds.
4. A Big Pac-Man can eat other small Pac-Man and ghosts.
5. When A Pac-Man eats all the food, the whole maze is renewed with food, dots and Power Pellets.
6. In each round, level winner is the last Pac-Man who survives.
